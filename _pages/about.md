I'm James Qiu, a computer science undergraduate currently
studying at the University of Washington.
Looking ahead, I'm starting fulltime at [Stripe][stripe]
once I graduate in the spring of 2022.

Previously, I've interned at Meta, Optiver, and Amazon, where
I've been able to work on some pretty neat stuff (merge conflict
resolution tooling, asynchronous task scheduling, combing through
logs of hardware test failures, etc).

Nowadays, you can find me playing volleyball with friends,
nagging my roommates to wash the dishes, and still wearing
those free company t-shirts. I also maintain this blog from
time to time.
