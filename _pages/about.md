I'm James Qiu, a freshly graduated computer science major
from the University of Washington.
I'm currently working fulltime at [Stripe][stripe]
on the Security team based out of Seattle. Feel free to reach out if you have
any questions or if you want a referral!

Previously, I've interned at ~~Facebook~~ Meta, Optiver, and Amazon, where
I've been able to work on some pretty neat stuff (merge conflict
resolution tooling, asynchronous task scheduling, combing through
logs of hardware test failures, etc).

Nowadays, you can find me playing volleyball with friends,
nagging my roommates to wash the dishes, and still wearing
those free company t-shirts. I also maintain this blog from
time to time.
