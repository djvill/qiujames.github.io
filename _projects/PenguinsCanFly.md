You’re a penguin - you’ve always dreamed of soaring through the sky, but you’re a chubby penguin. Now’s your chance to fly! Maneuver through the air with your hang glider, dodge obstacles to achieve high scores, and play as a party game with your friends in local multiplayer mode.

- Loveable Penguins (Duh)
- Cute Artic Villages
- Flight School (Tutorials)
- Flapping Launch Sequence
- Realistic Glider Physics
- Pesky Obstacles
- Collectable Fish
- Local Multiplayer
- Relaxing Music / Sound Effects
- Infinite Terrain Generation
- Multiple Terrain Types

There's really just a ton of features in the game;
it's impossible to mention it all.

We used an asset pack for our terrain assets and penguin models.
However, we did do some 3d modeling for custom flippers.  

Everything else was built from scratch in 10 weeks.
All code, from the glider physics, obstacle spawning,
and infinite terrain generation, was all written by the team.
Lots of tutorials were followed and much documentation
was scoured through.  
All cute scenes were crafted by hand with love by the
Penguins Can Fly team.

## Download Penguins Can Fly

There is a *ton* of care and attention to detail put into this little game
and it really shows when you first load into the app.
Developing this took so much time
but it was so so so rewarding.
We had so much fun playing this and
we hope you do too!

Download the APK here: [PenguinsCanFly][apk] (for Oculus Quest 2)

**A note to sensitive users**:
We designed the game to minimize motion sickness and we
did a *really* good job at doing so. It's really smooth!
(Trust me, I'm pretty sensitive too when it comes to VR/AR)
