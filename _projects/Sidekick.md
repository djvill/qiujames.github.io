Sidekick is an on-command assistant to help make cooking
with recipes faster, easier, and cleaner. Sidekick is loaded on your phone and
placed in your kitchen, where it will listen to your commands hands-free
to guide you through any recipe.

Our app verbally walks users through recipes step by step,
all while responding to the userâ€™s questions and commands.
Sidekick will figure out what you want, and answer you based on your recipe,
and will stay with you throughout your whole cooking process.  

Powered by Facebook's wit.ai NLP API, Sidekick requires absolutely
no preset command patterns to respond to audio commands.  
The app determines the intent behind any question worded in
any form and returns the relevant information the user wanted, all hands-free!
